
## Vehicle Physics Pro

An advanced vehicle physics simulation package for Unity 3D.

This documentation is structured as:

- **User Guide**: All you need to know for creating and using vehicles in your project.
- **Components**: Reference guide for the provided Unity components (Component > Vehicles).
- **Classes**: Reference of the provided classes you can use for creating and developing your own vehicles from scripting.
- **Advanced**: Special tasks for extending the vehicle features or implementing your own.

### Features

AAA+ vehicle physics simulation model
:	Built around a physics solver providing accurate results for all vehicle types and setups. The precision of the numeric results depends on the integration steps only.

State-of-the-art wheel and tire friction simulation
:	Provides accurate friction values under any situation. All torques acting in the wheel are properly combined resulting in accurate tire forces and correctly calculated wheel spin rate.

Modular component system
:	Vehicle components are independent units with inputs and/or outputs that can be connected in any combination. Any vehicle setup can be emulated by arranging and connecting components. Package includes standard vehicle components such as engine, clutch, gearbox, differentials, torque splitter, and more.
