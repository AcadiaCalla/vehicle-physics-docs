
## Vehicle Physics Pro

Vehicle Physics Pro is a comprehensive vehicle simulation library designed and conceived from
scratch for providing an accurate and fully customizable vehicle physics.

Vehicle Physics Pro is currently available as add-on for the development tool Unity 3D.

#### Features

Fully flexible modular component system
:	Vehicle components are independent units with inputs and/or outputs that can be connected in
	any combination. Any vehicle setup can be emulated by arranging and connecting components.
	Package includes standard vehicle components such as engine, clutch, gearbox, differentials,
	torque splitter, and more.

AAA+ vehicle physics simulation model
:	Built around a physics solver providing accurate results for all vehicle types and setups.
	The precision of the numeric results depends on the integration steps only.

State-of-the-art wheel and tire friction simulation
:	Provides accurate friction values under any situation. All torques acting in the wheel are
	properly combined resulting in accurate tire forces and correctly calculated wheel spin rate.
