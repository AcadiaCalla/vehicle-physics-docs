Advanced AAA+ vehicle physics simulation

:	Built around a physics solver providing accurate results for all vehicle types and setups.
	The precision of the numeric results depends on the integration steps only.

Modular implementation

:	Vehicle blocks are independent units with inputs and/or outputs that can be connected in
	any combination. Any vehicle setup can be emulated by arranging and connecting blocks.
	Package includes standard vehicle blocks such as engine, clutch, gearbox, differential,
	torque splitter, and more.

Advanced wheel and tire friction simulation

:	Provides accurate friction values in all situations. All torques acting in the wheel are
	properly combined resulting in accurate tire forces and correctly calculated wheel spin rate.

Realistic and coherent

: 	The underlying concept is a custom vehicle simulation model based on essential physics facts:
	forces, torques and frictions. This model is easier to understand and simpler to calculate than
	the commonly used models, yet providing physically accurate and realistic results.

!!! warning "&fa-warning:lg; Project under development: **Beta stage**"

	**Beta stage** means the project is mature and bug-free enough to be used in actual projects,
	but some features are yet to be developed and issues/bugs might appear. Main code is not
	expected to have significant changes. Still, everything is provided as is without any warranty.

	- Some components and scripts are yet to be written or completed.
	- Some features are yet to be implemented (see the Roadmap below).
	- Documentation is being actively written and updated. Several parts are yet to be completed
		or need a review.

!!! info "&fa-thumbs-o-up; Feedback is welcome!"

	- General usage, workflow, integration in current projects.
	- Simulation: components, settings, behavior.
	- Documentation: things you would want to learn, know about, or are not fully understood.
	- Documentation: typo and grammar fixes.
