---

A comprehensive vehicle simulation library designed and conceived from scratch for providing
fully accurate and customizable vehicle physics. Vehicle Physics Pro is available as editor add-on
for [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com).

### Features

Fully flexible modular component system

:	Vehicle components are independent units with inputs and/or outputs that can be connected in
	any combination. Any vehicle setup can be emulated by arranging and connecting components.
	Package includes standard vehicle components such as engine, clutch, gearbox, differential,
	torque splitter, and more.

AAA+ vehicle physics simulation

:	It's built around a physics solver providing accurate results for all vehicle types and setups.
	The precision of the numeric results depends on the integration steps only.

State-of-the-art wheel and tire friction simulation

:	Provides accurate friction values in all situations. All torques acting in the wheel are
	properly combined resulting in accurate tire forces and correctly calculated wheel spin rate.

Realistic and coherent

: 	The underlying concept is a custom vehicle simulation model based on essential physics facts:
	forces, torques and frictions. This model is easier to understand and simpler to calculate than
	the commonly used models, yet providing physically accurate realistic results.

### Licensing

Standard license (To Be Announced)

:	Will be available at the Unity Asset Store for $100. Includes the Vehicle Physics components,
	development API and examples.

Professional license add-on

:	Available now for [Early Access](early-access.md) (Alpha and Beta) for $200. Provides access to
	the latest 	updates via GIT repository, fully commented C# source code and direct support via
	Skype. 	Contact me at [edytado@gmail.com](mailto:edytado@gmail.com) for more information.

### Download & setup

To Be Announced.
