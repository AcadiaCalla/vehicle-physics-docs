!!! warning "&fa-warning; **Alpha stage**. Please have in mind:"

	**Alpha stage** means active research & development, with frequent changes that will surely
	break past dependencies. **Everything is provided as is without any warranty**.

	- Some components and scripts are yet to be written or completed.
	- Some actual components and scripts will be significantly modified.
	- Some features already available in the other package [Edy's Vehicle Physics](http://www.edy.es/dev/vehicle-physics)
	are yet to be ported here (i.e. driving aids...)
	- **Documentation is being actively written**. Many parts are still missing. Some documented
	features may not have been developed yet or may be described in a different way than they work
	right now. In some cases I'm even using the documentation as annotated roadmap for the upcoming
	developments.
    - **This is a Unity 5 project**, but the repository also contains a branch for Unity 4. Vehicle
	Physics Pro is compatible with both.
	- **[Blender](http://www.blender.org)** must be installed for the 3D objects to be imported.
	This requirement will be lifted at some point during the Beta stage.

!!! info "&fa-thumbs-o-up; Feedback is welcome!"

	- General usage, workflow, integration in current projects.
	- Simulation: components, settings, behavior.
	- Documentation: things you would want to learn, know about, or are not fully understood.
	- Documentation: typo and grammar fixes.
